'''
There is a nested for loop.
With just one for loop that iterates through the entire list
the runtime complexity would be O(n), but because for each
entry in one list you are running through the second list
the runtime complexity is O(n^2)

# ---------- Stretch Goal -----------
# Python has built-in tools that allow for a very efficient approach to this problem
# What's the best time you can accomplish?  Thare are no restrictions on techniques or data
# structures, but you may not import any additional libraries that you did not write yourself.
